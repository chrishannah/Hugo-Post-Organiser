# Hugo Post Organiser

A very minimal (and specific) post organiser for Hugo post files.

It takes a single directly full of markdown files, organises them by year and month, and writes the files to the specified output directory.

**Disclaimer**: This code was written to serve my own purpose. It works for me. It may not work for you. Use at your own risk. Good luck. Have fun. Don't @ me.
